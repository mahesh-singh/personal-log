# Carlisle

This is a sample site built with [Carlisle](https://github.com/thesephist/carlisle), a Hugo template by [Linus](https://thesephist.com). You can see a more detailed example of the theme's design in the [Markdown styling demo page](/posts/markdown-syntax/).

The _Carlisle_ template focuses on three goals

1. Minimal but tasteful design
2. Effortless responsiveness
3. Extensibility and flexibility

The Carlisle template is the basis for [thesephist.com](https://thesephist.com), my personal site, as well as a few other static sites I've made. You can see a live demo of this template at [carlisle.thesephist.vercel.app](https://carlisle.thesephist.vercel.app).
