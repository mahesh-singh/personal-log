Man sitting on his desk and thinking about what to do. Mind is full of mud and things are all over the place. Its like his desk where lots of books all either read couple of pages or didn't move beyond couple of line. His mind is also like that lots things and nothing on one direction. Jumping all around. Like his desk where noting at their place. multiple notebooks, pens some are working some are not. Notebook also filled multiple pages with to do list and notes but never turn back to see what was written. Reading those notes a kind of feel honted like understing what going in mind. there are so much though in mind were noting make sense like browser on is mac, lots of tabs but you can con't find what on those tab. Mind keep looking for something new to avoid what running there like when looking for the tab, and open a new tab keep searvhing for something new. Like something new will discover a magic. 

While all these thing are running in his mind he hear his kids voice and just remember that he had his 16 annuarsery last friday and today want to go out for lunch. not sure where to go. Suddenly he hear something which is about his kid not about his kid but he feel like and feel desapoited.
