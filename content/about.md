# Hi, I’m Mahesh.

**I build web products and lead engineers. I’m an engineering manager, a software engineer and everything in between.**

I've been a professional software engineer since 2003 and building and managing high performing software engineering teams at the 3Pillar Global.

I’m particularly interested in building and managing high performing software engineering teams, system designing, full stack development, distributed systems, learning new stuff and applying it while solving the problems

Apart from computers, I really enjoy reading, walking, playing with my daughters.

If you have any questions or just want to chat, you can drop me an [email](mailto:singh.mahesh@gmail.com).
