      <description>Whenever I read a book, I try to underline things and later try to convert into digital notes. It almost become two phase revision of the book. These notes are from Martin Kleppmann&amp;rsquo;s book: Designing Data-Intensive Applications.
Disclaimers:
 These notes are not a substitute of the book. These notes are from my understanding of the topic and typed manually (Yes I prefer physical book over digital one) . There might be the case when I missed something.</description>
