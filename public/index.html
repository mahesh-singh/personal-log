I&rsquo;ve been a professional software engineer since 2003 and I build and manage high performing software engineering teams at the Three Pillar Global.
I’m particularly interested in building and manage high performing software engineering teams, distributed systems, learning new stuff and applying it while solving the problems.
Apart from computers, I really enjoy reading, walking, playing with my daughters." />
